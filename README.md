# Data Diabetes prediction




## Data set

Throughout this notebook I will work on the Diabetes prediction dataset. The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.

## Problem definition

Research question: How do we build a model that is able to predict the diabetes?

The main focus of this project is to build a model that is able to predict the diabetes, this is done using a few feature columns related to diabetes.

Other questions to answer:

How should you deal with data cleaning? What is the impact of the unbalanced data on your results? How can you mitigate it? What is the implication of using the random sampler, should we sample before diving the data into train and test, or after it? What happens if we apply the model trained on the sampled data on the entire dataset, does it work?
